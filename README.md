# :red_car::maple_leaf: leaf2mqtt :maple_leaf::red_car:
leaf2mqtt takes data from Nissan Leaf connected vehicles - usually consumed via a mobile app, into MQTT based pub/sub messaging for integrating into other applications / home automation solutions. 

> :warning: Be aware that long term polling from this container against your Leaf without regular (weekly) usage / charging could drain your 12V battery. 

This module has been reported to work on the following Leaf models:
- :red_car: 2018+ Leaf 40kWh from Canada
- :red_car: 2018+ Leaf 62 kWh e+ from UK

For this to work with other applications / Home Automation systems - an MQTT broker is required to interconnect. leaf2mqtt operates as an MQTT client.  

This should work with multiple Leafs, has only been briefly tested. Please open an issue with feedback if you encounter issues.

## :rocket: Setup
#### Running leaf2mqtt
leaf2mqtt is packaged as a container. This is an automatically published / updated at the [k8s-at-home](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/container-images/pkgs/container/leaf2mqtt) container registry. This can be used immediately without any building required.

|-----------|----------|-------------|
| LEAF_USERNAME | No | Your NissanConnect username ||
| LEAF_PASSWORD | No | Your NissanConnect password |
| LEAF_TYPE | No | newerThanMay2019, olderCanada or olderUSA |
| MQTT_HOST | No | IP or hostname of your mqtt broker. Localhost or 127.0.0.1 may not work when using Docker, use real host LAN IP |
| MQTT_PORT | Yes | Port of your mqtt broker. Default is **1883**  |
| MQTT_USERNAME | Yes | Your mqtt username |
| MQTT_PASSWORD | Yes | Your mqtt password |
| MQTT_BASE_TOPIC | Yes | The root MQTT topic for leaf2mqtt. Default is **leaf** |
| UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES | Yes | Time between automatic status refresh. Default is **60** |
| CHARGING_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES* | Yes | Time between automatic status refresh when charging. Default is **60** |
| LOG_LEVEL | Yes | The log verbosity used by leaf2mqtt. Default is **Warning** [Possible Levels](https://pub.dev/packages/logging) |

#####Example:
```
docker run --restart always -e LEAF_USERNAME="myusername@somewhere.com" -e LEAF_PASSWORD="Some P4ssword!" -e LEAF_TYPE="newerThanMay2019" -e MQTT_HOST=192.168.1.111 -e UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES=1440 --name leaf2mqtt ghcr.io/k8s-at-home/leaf2mqtt:latest
```

:information_source: The `CHARGING_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` value will only be used after the ongoing `UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES` is elapsed and the Leaf is charging.

### :house: Home Assistant Integration
#### Sensor examples
```
sensors:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: leaf_battery_level
    # Since VIN is not specified, it will represent the state from the first vehicle in the account.
    state_topic: "leaf/battery/percentage"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: battery

  - platform: mqtt
    name: leaf_battery_last_updated
    # Since VIN is not specified, it will represent the state from the first Leaf in the account.
    state_topic: "leaf/battery/lastUpdatedDateTimeUtc"
    device_class: timestamp

  - platform: mqtt
    name: leaf_battery_last_received
    # You can specify the vin if you prefer or if you have more than one Leaf.
    state_topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/battery/lastReceivedDateTimeUtc"
    device_class: timestamp
```

#### Recommended Battery Status Update Script
In Home Assistant, calling a script like this `- service: script.some_script_name` within another script or automation will actually stop the execution of the calling script until `script.some_script_name` terminates, unlike using `script.turn_on`. Knowing this, you can ensure you have the latest state for your leaf before continuing an automation using a script like this:
```
update_leaf_battery:
  # Using queued will ensure you do not update twice at the same time and will prevent
  # subsequent invocations from asking an update right away because of the while's conditions.
  # All the callers will also wait for the result.
  mode: queued
  sequence:
    - repeat:
        while:
          # Used with the sensors in the section above, this condition will
          # ensure we continue until the states are really updated.
          # It will also prevent subsequent calls from unnecessarily requesting
          # an update before the current state is 10 minutes old.
          - >
            {{ as_timestamp(now()) -
              as_timestamp(states('sensor.leaf_battery_last_updated')) > 600 }}

          # We also stop the loop after 4 tries since Nissan servers can send the same
          # old data many times in a row. I think this happens when the state did not really changed
          # or the Leaf is unreachable. 
          - "{{ repeat.index <= 4 }}"

        sequence:
          # We publish the update command for the car. 
          # You can also ommit the VIN to target the first Leaf in the account.
          # You can also request update for every state for one Leaf by removing the /battery section
          - service: mqtt.publish
            data:
              topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/command/battery"
              payload: "update"
          # We now wait until we actually have received a response or if we timed out.
          # This does not mean that the received data is the latest. This is why
          # we check sensor.leaf_battery_last_updated in the while condition.
          - wait_for_trigger:
              - platform: state
                entity_id: sensor.leaf_battery_last_received
            timeout: 600
    # Let's have a cool down to give time to Home Assistant to update all the states.
    - delay: "00:00:10"
```

#### Home-Assistant Climate Integration
It's possible to build a climate based control for the Leaf in Home-Assistant. This allows you to use the standard climate controls rather that building separate sensors / input switches. 

:information_source: The sensor is required to capture the temperature set for the `mode_command_topic`
```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "LEAF Target Temp"
    state_topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/command/climateTargetTempC"
    device_class: temperature
    unit_of_measurement: "C"

climate: 
  - platform: mqtt
    name: "Leaf Climate"
    modes: 
      - "auto"
      - "off"
    mode_command_topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/command/climate"
    mode_command_template: "{{'startC ' + states('sensor.leaf_target_temp') | round() | string() if value == 'auto' else 'stop'}}"
    mode_state_topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/climate/RunningStatus"
    mode_state_template: "{{'auto' if value == 'true' else 'off'}}"
    current_temperature_topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/climate/cabinTemperatureC"
    temperature_state_topic: "leaf/XXXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/climate/targetTemperatureC"
    min_temp: 16
    max_temp: 26
    precision: 1.0
    temperature_command_topic: "leaf/XXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/command/climateTargetTempC"
```

#### Home-Assistant Location Integration
You can add your Leaf as a `device_tracker` type in Home-Assistant. This allows you to track in a similar way to phones / people, and easily display location updates on a map. 

```
device_tracker:
  - platform: mqtt_json
    devices:
      Leaf: leaf/XXXXSOMEXVINXXXXX/location/location
```

- Forked from [yp87/leaf2mqtt](https://github.com/yp87/leaf2mqtt). Thanks for a great basis on which to enhance. 
- Using libraries from [Tobias Westergaard Kjeldsen](https://gitlab.com/tobiaswkjeldsen) to connect with the nissan leaf's APIs. Those libraries are also used for his [MyLeaf app](https://gitlab.com/tobiaswkjeldsen/carwingsflutter).
